        <h1>Overview</h1>

        <p>
          Melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin cancer, developing in the melanocytes—the pigment-producing cells of the skin. Although it is less common than other skin cancers, melanoma is more likely to spread to other parts of the body if not caught early.
        </p>
        <h2>Types of Melanoma</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Superficial Spreading Melanoma:</strong> The most common type, typically appearing as an irregularly shaped mole that changes in color or size.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Nodular Melanoma:</strong> An aggressive form that often presents as a dark, raised bump and may grow rapidly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lentigo Maligna Melanoma:</strong> Often found in older adults on sun-damaged areas, particularly the face.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Acral Lentiginous Melanoma:</strong> Occurs on the palms, soles, or under the nails and is more common in individuals with darker skin tones.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Asymmetry in moles or spots</li>
          <li>Irregular, scalloped, or poorly defined borders</li>
          <li>Variation in color (different shades of brown, black, or sometimes red, blue, or white)</li>
          <li>Diameter greater than 6mm</li>
          <li>Evolution or change in a mole’s appearance</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <img src="https://www.mayoclinic.org/-/media/kcms/gbs/patient-consumer/images/2013/11/15/17/40/ds00190_-ds00439_-ds00924_-ds00925_im02400_c7_skincancerthu_jpg.jpg" alt=""> <br> <br>
        <p>
          The primary cause of melanoma is excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning beds. Genetic predisposition and a family history of melanoma can also contribute to the risk.
        </p>
        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher daily.</li>
          <li>Avoid prolonged exposure to the sun, especially during peak hours (10 AM to 4 PM).</li>
          <li>Wear protective clothing, hats, and sunglasses when outdoors.</li>
          <li>Avoid tanning beds and deliberate sunbathing.</li>
          <li>Regularly examine your skin and consult a dermatologist for any suspicious changes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Surgical Excision:</strong> Removal of the melanoma along with a margin of healthy tissue.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Immunotherapy:</strong> Boosts the body’s immune system to help fight cancer cells.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Targeted Therapy:</strong> Uses drugs designed to target specific genetic mutations in melanoma cells.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy:</strong> Often used for advanced cases.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>When to See a Doctor</h2>
        <p>
          If you notice any changes in your skin, particularly in the appearance of moles or spots that become asymmetrical, have irregular borders, change in color, or increase in size, consult a dermatologist immediately.
