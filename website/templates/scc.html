        <p>
          Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) is the second most common type of skin cancer.
          It develops in the squamous cells, which make up the majority of the skin’s
          outer layers (epidermis). SCC is often linked to long-term exposure to
          <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/radiation-health/features/uv-radiation.html">ultraviolet (UV) radiation</a>
          from the sun or tanning beds.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Types of Squamous Cell Carcinoma</h2> 
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Cutaneous SCC:</strong> Occurs on sun-exposed areas of the skin,
            such as the face, ears, and hands.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mucosal SCC:</strong> Develops on mucous membranes found inside the
            body, including the mouth, throat, or genital areas.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Invasive SCC:</strong> Grows deeper into the skin and can affect
            underlying tissues.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Symptoms</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>A firm, red nodule or a scaly, crusted lesion</li>
          <li>A persistent sore or lesion that may bleed</li>
          <li>A growth with a central depression or ulceration</li>
          <li>Changes in the appearance of an existing mole or lesion</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <img src="https://www.mayoclinic.org/-/media/kcms/gbs/patient-consumer/images/2013/11/15/17/40/ds00190_-ds00439_-ds00924_-ds00925_im02400_c7_skincancerthu_jpg.jpg" alt=""> <br> <br>
        <p>
          Prolonged exposure to UV radiation is the primary cause of SCC. Additional
          risk factors include fair skin, a history of sunburns, exposure to chemical
          carcinogens, chronic skin inflammation, and a weakened immune system.
        </p>
        <h2>Prevention</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Apply broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher every day.</li>
          <li>Avoid excessive sun exposure, particularly between 10 AM and 4 PM.</li>
          <li>Wear protective clothing, hats, and sunglasses when outdoors.</li>
          <li>Avoid tanning beds to reduce unnecessary UV exposure.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Surgical Excision:</strong> Removal of the cancerous tissue along
            with a margin of healthy skin.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mohs Surgery:</strong> A tissue-sparing procedure ideal for SCC in
            cosmetically sensitive areas.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cryotherapy:</strong> Freezing of superficial lesions using liquid
            nitrogen.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Radiation Therapy:</strong> Often used for advanced cases or for
            patients who cannot undergo surgery.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>When to See a Doctor</h2>
        <p>
          If you notice any new, persistent, or changing skin lesions—especially those
          that are scaly, red, or non-healing—consult a dermatologist immediately.
