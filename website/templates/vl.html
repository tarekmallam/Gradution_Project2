        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          Vascular lesions are skin abnormalities that result from irregularities in blood vessels. They can appear as red, purple, or blue marks on the skin and vary widely in appearance and size. Although most vascular lesions are benign, some may require treatment for cosmetic reasons or due to potential complications.

        <p>
          Vascular lesions are often caused by congenital malformations or abnormalities in the formation of blood vessels. In some cases, hormonal changes, sun exposure, or minor skin injuries can contribute to their development.
        </p>
        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Limit excessive sun exposure to help prevent the exacerbation of some vascular lesions</li>
          <li>Use broad-spectrum sunscreen and protective clothing when outdoors</li>
          <li>Regularly monitor your skin for any new or changing lesions</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Laser Therapy:</strong> Targets the blood vessels to reduce the appearance of lesions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cryotherapy:</strong> Involves freezing the lesion to diminish its appearance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sclerotherapy:</strong> An injection treatment that causes the blood vessels to collapse and fade.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Surgical Excision:</strong> Removal of the lesion, typically considered if the lesion causes discomfort or is cosmetically bothersome.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>When to See a Doctor</h2>
        <p>
          Although most vascular lesions are benign, you should consult a dermatologist if you notice any new or rapidly changing lesions, if a lesion becomes painful, bleeds, or if you have concerns about its appearance.
