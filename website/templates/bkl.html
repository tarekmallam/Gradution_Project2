          Benign Keratosis-like Lesions (BKL) refer to a group of non-cancerous skin growths that often exhibit a keratotic, or scaly, appearance. Although these lesions may resemble malignant growths, they are benign and commonly found in older adults.
        </p>
        <h2>Types of Benign Keratosis-like Lesions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Seborrheic Keratosis:</strong> These are one of the most common types of BKL, appearing as brown, black, or tan lesions with a “stuck-on” look.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Solar Lentigo:</strong> Often known as liver spots, these flat, pigmented lesions develop as a result of chronic sun exposure.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lichen Planus-Like Keratosis:</strong> Typically presenting as a solitary, red or brown papule, this lesion may develop from pre-existing keratoses.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Well-defined lesions with a rough or scaly texture</li>
          <li>Varied color, ranging from light tan to dark brown or black</li>
          <li>Generally asymptomatic but may itch or become irritated</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <img src="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2023/12/06/2023.12.06.23299413/F1.large.jpg" alt=""> <br> <br>
        <p>
          The development of BKL is primarily associated with the natural aging process and prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Genetic predisposition may also play a role. Despite their sometimes alarming appearance, these lesions do not pose a cancer risk.
        </p>
        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Limit excessive sun exposure and use broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher daily.</li>
          <li>Wear protective clothing, hats, and sunglasses when outdoors.</li>
          <li>Perform regular self-examinations to monitor for any changes in existing skin lesions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Cryotherapy:</strong> Freezing the lesion is a common method for removal, especially when the lesion is cosmetically bothersome.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Curettage:</strong> Involves scraping away the lesion, often combined with electrodessication.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Laser Therapy:</strong> A precise method used to remove lesions with minimal scarring.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Topical Treatments:</strong> Certain creams or other topical medications may be applied in select cases.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>When to See a Doctor</h2>
        <p>
          Although BKLs are benign, consult a dermatologist if you notice rapid changes in the lesion’s size, shape, or color, or if it begins to bleed or cause discomfort. Professional evaluation is important to rule out any malignant conditions.
