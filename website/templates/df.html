        <h1>Overview</h1>

        <p>
          Dermatofibroma (DF) is a common, benign skin lesion that typically appears as a firm, small nodule. Often found on the lower legs, these lesions are usually harmless but may raise cosmetic concerns for some individuals.
        </p>
        <h2>Characteristics and Types</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Common Dermatofibroma:</strong> The typical form, presenting as a firm, round, and sometimes pigmented nodule usually less than 1 cm in diameter.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Atypical Dermatofibroma:</strong> Less frequently, these lesions may exhibit variations in color or texture while remaining benign.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Firm, raised nodule with a smooth or slightly dimpled surface</li>
          <li>Often pigmented, ranging from light brown to dark brown or reddish tones</li>
          <li>Generally asymptomatic, though some lesions may become tender or itchy</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <img src="https://static.elsevier.es/multimedia/03650596/0000010000000001/v1_202501030752/S0365059624002137/v1_202501030752/en/main.assets/gr4.jpeg" alt=""> <br> <br>
        <p>
          The exact cause of dermatofibromas is not fully understood. They are thought to result from minor skin trauma—such as insect bites or small injuries—which may trigger a localized fibrous tissue response.
        </p>
        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>There are no definitive preventive measures, as dermatofibromas are benign and often related to minor skin injuries.</li>
          <li>Maintaining good skin care and promptly treating minor wounds may help reduce their occurrence.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Observation:</strong> Most dermatofibromas do not require treatment unless they cause discomfort or cosmetic concerns.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Surgical Excision:</strong> Removal may be recommended if the lesion is symptomatic or for definitive diagnosis.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cryotherapy or Laser Treatment:</strong> Alternative options for lesion removal, though recurrence is possible.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>When to See a Doctor</h2>
        <p>
          While dermatofibromas are benign, it is advisable to consult a dermatologist if you notice any changes in the size, shape, or color of a lesion, or if it becomes painful, itchy, or begins to bleed.
