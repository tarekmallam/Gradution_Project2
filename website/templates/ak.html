        <p>
          Actinic Keratosis (AK) is a rough, scaly patch on the skin caused by long-term exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Often considered a precancerous lesion, AK primarily appears on sun-exposed areas such as the face, ears, scalp, neck, and hands. Early detection and treatment are crucial to prevent potential progression to squamous cell carcinoma.

        <h2>Types and Variants</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Hyperkeratotic AK:</strong> Characterized by thick, scaly patches due to an overproduction of keratin.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Atrophic AK:</strong> Presents as thinner, less raised patches, often with a reddish hue.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Rough, dry, or scaly patches on the skin</li>
          <li>Lesions that may be red, pink, or skin-colored</li>
          <li>Mild itching or tenderness in the affected area</li>
          <li>Persistent patches that do not heal</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The primary cause of actinic keratosis is chronic exposure to UV radiation from the sun or tanning beds. Risk factors include fair skin, a history of sunburns, and prolonged outdoor activities without proper sun protection.

        <ul>
          <li>Use broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher) daily</li>
          <li>Avoid sun exposure during peak hours (10 AM to 4 PM)</li>
          <li>Wear protective clothing, hats, and sunglasses when outdoors</li>
          <li>Regularly examine your skin for any changes or new lesions</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Cryotherapy:</strong> Freezing the lesion with liquid nitrogen is a common treatment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Topical Medications:</strong> Creams such as 5-fluorouracil, imiquimod, or diclofenac can be used to treat AK.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Photodynamic Therapy:</strong> Involves applying a light-sensitive agent followed by exposure to a light source to destroy abnormal cells.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Curettage:</strong> Scraping away the lesion, sometimes combined with laser therapy.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>When to See a Doctor</h2>
        <p>
          Consult a dermatologist if you notice any persistent or changing patches on your skin, especially on sun-exposed areas. Early evaluation and treatment are important to prevent progression to skin cancer.
