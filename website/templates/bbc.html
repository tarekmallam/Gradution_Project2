                <img src="https://assets.mayoclinic.org/content/dam/media/global/images/2023/02/10/basal-cell-carcinoma-on-white-skin.jpg" alt=""> <br> <br>
                <p>
                    Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of skin cancer. It originates in the basal cells, which are responsible for producing new skin cells. 
                    BCC typically occurs due to prolonged exposure to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/radiation-health/features/uv-radiation.html">ultraviolet (UV) radiation</a>, primarily from sunlight. 
                    It often manifests as a transparent bump, but it can appear in other forms. While BCC rarely spreads to other parts of the body, early detection and treatment are crucial.
                </p>
                <h2>Types of Basal Cell Carcinoma</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nodular BCC:</strong> Appears as a shiny, skin-colored or pink bump with visible blood vessels.</li>
                    <li><strong>Superficial BCC:</strong> A red, scaly patch that may resemble eczema.</li>
                    <li><strong>Infiltrative BCC:</strong> A less distinct form that can be challenging to diagnose.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Symptoms</h2>
                <img src="https://assets.mayoclinic.org/content/dam/media/global/images/2023/02/09/basal-cell-carcinoma-on-brown-skin.jpg" alt=""> <br> <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>A pearly or waxy bump</li>
                    <li>A sore that doesn't heal</li>
                    <li>Red patches or irritated areas</li>
                    <li>Scar-like areas with undefined borders</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Causes</h2>
                <img src="https://assets.mayoclinic.org/content/dam/media/en/images/2023/02/09/where-skin-cancer-develops.jpg" alt="">  <br> <br>
                <p>
                    The primary cause of basal cell carcinoma is prolonged exposure to UV radiation. 
                    Other risk factors include fair skin, a history of sunburns, excessive tanning, and a weakened immune system.
                </p>
                <h2>Prevention</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher).</li>
                    <li>Avoid peak sun hours (10 AM - 4 PM).</li>
                    <li>Wear protective clothing such as hats and sunglasses.</li>
                    <li>Perform regular skin self-exams.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mohs Surgery:</strong> A precise technique that removes cancer layer by layer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Excisional Surgery:</strong> Removal of the tumor with a margin of healthy skin.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cryotherapy:</strong> Freezing cancerous cells using liquid nitrogen.</li>
                    <li><strong>Topical Medications:</strong> Creams like imiquimod or fluorouracil for superficial BCC.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>When to See a Doctor</h2>
                <p>If you notice unusual skin growths, persistent sores, or changes in existing moles, consult a dermatologist.</p>
